# FULL STACK DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT
have copied some of my work from previous project yet it is in php and not node, atm I am still learning react and not fully into it. I may say I over expect my skill as Full stack developer. 
Now I understand that I can only work as backend and apply some javascript to frontend with validations.
